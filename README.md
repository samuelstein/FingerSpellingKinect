FingerSpellingKinect
====================

Independent Coursework @ HTW Berlin in Media Informatics Master

This project tries to find out how the Microsoft Kinect for Windows could help to recognize and translate Sign language from the depth image of the sensor to ordinary speech or text. The independent coursework is separated into two parts: evaluation and prototypal imple-mentation of software who transcribes sign language symbols which are recorded before.

Application needs OpenNI x64 (OpenNI SDK v1.5.4.0 x64) and Primesense Kinect driver (SensorKinect 5.1.2.1 x64) for correct working.

The application comes with the following recorded gestures: a, b, i, g, h, v, y, l, u, w, o, c, f
More gestures can be recorded to db.
